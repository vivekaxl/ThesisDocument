\section{Cost-Aware Resource Optimization}
\label{sec:cost-aware}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Bayesian Optimization: guided search (do not need to search whole configuration space)
  	\begin{itemize}
  	  \item not sure the distribution of performance/cost
  	\end{itemize}
  \item Search with knowledge about limiting factors
  \item Bayesian optimization + resource vectors + application behavior
\end{itemize}
