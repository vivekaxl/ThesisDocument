\section{Summary}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this chapter, we have presented the cost-delay product (CDP),
a straightforward way to analyze the time-cost tradeoff.
We study three data-intensive applications
(page rank, web log analysis, and regression), and
found that there always exists such a tradeoff between
execution \emph{time} and resource \emph{cost}.

However, choosing the \emph{best} configuration is not straightforward because
there is not a clear relationship between \emph{time} and \emph{cost}.
Besides, there are numerous configurations to choose.
Exhaustive search is not feasible because evaluation of an configuration
is very expensive.
We argue that low-level performance metrics are good indicators
for identifying application performance.
We plan to develop a guided search algorithm that leverages
low-level performance metrics
for efficiently finding the most cost-effective configurations,
given time and cost objectives.
