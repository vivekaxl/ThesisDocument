\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Cloud architecture tuning (CAT) is essential
to maximize the performance of an application
while keeping the deployment cost down.
In this chapter, we identify key elements for an effective CAT method.
We design and implement a novel system \scout, which delivers
\emph{efficient}, \emph{effective} and \emph{reliable} search performance.


%Today most applications are hosted in the cloud.
%It is essential to maximize the performance of an application while keeping the deployment cost down.
%Machine learning and sampling techniques have been previously proposed to
%build models to predict the performance of cloud configurations.
%However, the techniques proposed in prior work are either expensive to train or are unreliable---if trained on %sparse samples. 

%Our method, \scout, is different to the previously proposed directions and promotes learning from previous %experience---optimization process.
%We advocate using historical data to identify regions on the configuration space, which might contain the best cloud configuration. To use the historical data, we propose a new modeling scheme which use low-level metrics along with pair-wise modeling technique to transfer knowledge from one optimization process to the other.
