\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
Collective optimization is promising and yet practical for deploying multiple workloads in clouds.
The collective optimization problem is similar to the multi-armed bandit problem.
With existing heuristics, we are able to derive the exemplar cloud configuration that works well across a group of workloads. Collective optimization greatly reduces measurement cost while producing optimal to satisfactory performance.
