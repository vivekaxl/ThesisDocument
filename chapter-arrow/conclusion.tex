\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this chapter, we identify and demonstrate the fragility of Bayesian Optimization in finding the best cloud VM type.
The fragility arises from the inadequate information used to represent the instance space.
This fragility affects prior work which uses only instance space to guide Bayesian Optimization.
To overcome the problem of fragility, we augment the instance space with low-level performance information. 
We present our method, Augmented Bayesian Optimization, which seamlessly integrates the low-level metrics (obtained with negligible overhead) to the surrogate model.
Additionally, we make design choices to modify existing BO to make more informed decisions.
We demonstrate that Augmented BO can find the best VM type across all workloads. In 46 out of 107 workloads, Augmented BO outperforms the state-of-the-art Bayesian optimization method in terms of both performance and search-cost.  

More generally, we conclude that it is often insufficient to use general-purpose off-the-shelf methods (BO in this case) for selecting the best VM without augmenting those methods with essential systems knowledge such as CPU utilization, working memory size and I/O wait time.  In our future work, we plan to further augment Bayesian Optimizer with historical performance data to further reduce the search cost.
