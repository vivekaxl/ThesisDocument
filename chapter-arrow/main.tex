\chapter{Low-Level Augmented Bayesian Optimization}
\label{chapter:arrow}

\bo is a class of sequential model-based optimization, which
is used in \cherrypick to solve the CAT problem.
In this chapter, we examine the effectiveness of \bo
in finding the best cloud configurations.
We identify a \emph{fragility} issue in \naive \bo 
, and propose using low-level performance information
to enhance \bo.
