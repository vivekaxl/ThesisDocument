\section{Objectives}



We also look at other metrics for comparing CAT methods.
First, it is important to deliver \emph{reliable}
search performance and search cost across different workloads.
Some optimizers may encounter the fragility issue because
the search space is hard to model~\cite{Hsu2018Arrow}.
Second, a CAT method must be \emph{scalable}.
\emph{Ernest}, for example, must build a prediction model
for each VM family. 
Last, the optimizer must use a generic approach for adapting to
the rapid changes in cloud computing and software systems.
Exploiting workload information and system internals
can improve prediction performance but
makes a CAT method less applicable to distinct systems
~\cite{Wang2004,Venkataraman2016}.
