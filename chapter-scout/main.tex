\chapter{Scout: System Design and Implementation}
\label{chapter:scout}

To solve the CAT problem,
one-shot prediction (such as \paris~\cite{Yadwadkar2017}) suffers from
high variance of prediction error
while \bo (such as \cherrypick~\cite{Alipourfard2017} and \arrow~\cite{Hsu2018Arrow},
described in Chapter~\ref{chapter:arrow}) must
tolerate the \emph{cold-start} issue.
In this chapter, we design and implement an
effective, efficient and reliable system that recommends
the best architectural configurations 
that satisfies performance and cost objectives
to run a given workload.
