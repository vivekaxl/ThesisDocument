\chapter{Finding faster configurations using flash}
\label{chapter:flash}

This chapter presents an approach to estimating end-to-end performance
of distributed storage systems.
We explain why low-level performance metrics are a desirable proxy
for estimating end-to-end performance.
We then present our automatic model building tool for generating
robust and accurate performance models.
