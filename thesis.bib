abstract="The problem of automatically tuning multiple parameters for pattern recognition Support Vector Machines (SVMs) is considered. This is done by minimizing some estimates of the generalization error of SVMs using a gradient descent algorithm over the set of parameters. Usual methods for choosing parameters, based on exhaustive search become intractable as soon as the number of parameters exceeds two. Some experimental results assess the feasibility of our approach for a large number of parameters (more than 100) and demonstrate an improvement of generalization performance.",

abstract = {The scaling push-relabel method is an important theoretical development in the area of minimum-cost flow algorithms. We study practical implementations of this method. We are especially interested in heuristics which improve real-life performance of the method. Our implementation works very well over a wide range of problem classes. Some heuristics we develop may apply to other network algorithms. Our experimental work on the minimum-cost flow problem motivated theoretical work on related problems.},
