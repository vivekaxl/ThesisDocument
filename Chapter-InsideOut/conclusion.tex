Ensuring end-to-end performance in software-defined storage (SDS) requires accurate performance models. This chapter presents Inside-Out, a tool that provides reliable and consistent prediction of end-to-end performance of distributed storage systems using low-level system metrics. Our evaluation indicates that Inside-Out is able to generate accurate prediction models even when the storage environment differs significantly from the training phase. Inside-Out is generic in nature because it does not use application or protocol specific data for building performance models. Although we used Ceph as an example distributed storage service to evaluate Inside-Out, we believe it should be applicable to other storage systems as well with minor modifications.
